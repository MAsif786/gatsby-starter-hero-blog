* Easily customizable primary menu. In frontmatter of pages, shownInMenu true|false determines whether it will be shown in the primary menu or not and the optional menuTitle enables the label assigned to the page in the primary menu to be different than the title as is the case for this particular page.

Here is the frontmatter for this page. If menuTitle had been eliminated, the label in the primary menu for this page would have been `About This Site`.

```yaml
title: About This Site
menuTitle: About
shownInMenu: true
```
